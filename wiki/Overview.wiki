BZWeb is an online based tool developed by mrapple which allows multiple users to manage bzfs instances.

Users can start, stop, restart, and customize everything about their server.

There is also an administration panel which allows the server administrator to keep tabs on users and enable/disable certain features.

For questions, join ##bzbureau on irc.freenode.net and ask mrapple.
